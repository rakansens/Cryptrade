# Pattern Persistence Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Store Enhancement
- Added `patterns: Map<string, PatternData>` to chart store state
- Added pattern actions: `addPattern`, `removePattern`, `clearPatterns`, `getPattern`
- Created `usePatternActions` hook for pattern management

### 2. Event Handler Updates
- Updated `useAgentEventHandlers` to store patterns in the chart store when added
- Pattern additions now persist in store before rendering
- Pattern removals update both store and renderer

### 3. Pattern Restoration
- Created `usePatternRestore` hook to restore patterns after chart re-initialization
- Patterns are automatically re-rendered when chart is ready
- Ensures patterns persist across timeframe changes

### 4. Type Fixes
- Added 'pattern' to ChartDrawing type union
- Fixed type mismatches in drawing data validation
- Updated ChatSidebar to use `messagesBySession` correctly

## How It Works

1. **Pattern Addition Flow**:
   - AI agent proposes pattern
   - User approves pattern
   - `chart:addPattern` event is dispatched
   - Pattern is stored in chart store
   - Pattern is rendered on chart

2. **Timeframe Change Flow**:
   - User changes timeframe
   - Chart is re-initialized (unavoidable due to data requirements)
   - `usePatternRestore` hook detects chart ready state
   - All patterns from store are re-rendered

3. **Pattern Removal Flow**:
   - User or system removes pattern
   - Pattern is removed from store
   - Pattern is removed from chart

## Benefits

- ✅ Patterns persist across timeframe changes
- ✅ No chart flicker when approving patterns (store update is synchronous)
- ✅ Patterns can be managed like regular drawings
- ✅ Pattern state is preserved in undo/redo operations (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Unified Drawing System**:
   - Convert patterns to use the same rendering system as regular drawings
   - Store pattern visualization as multiple drawing primitives

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Batch pattern restoration to reduce rendering calls
   - Implement pattern caching for faster re-rendering

3. **Pattern Serialization**:
   - Save patterns to localStorage for persistence across sessions
   - Export/import pattern configurations

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Add a pattern through AI chat
2. Change timeframe - pattern should persist
3. Toggle indicators - pattern should remain
4. Remove pattern - should work correctly
5. Add multiple patterns - all should persist
